# MSE 110: Project 3 - Barcode Scanner

This project consists of a Lego Mindstorms EV3 ROBOTC program and a MATLAB program.

The ROBOTC program moves the robot forward to scan a barcode of arbitrary size, and saves the data to the datalog. The MATLAB program takes the data as input and decodes it to a barcode value.

The MATLAB program is also capable of reading a barcode from an image file.

For instructions on setting up the dependencies for MATLAB or GNU Octave, see the README in the parent directory.
